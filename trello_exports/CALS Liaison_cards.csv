CALS Reference Request,"Hi Andrew,

We're starting to get these for review, which is a nice change and was prompted by a unit on campus drastically understating their need for library resources on one of these forms. Please take a quick look at the referenced section and reply to me and Sande with your comments - I'm guessing there's no need for additional resources, but if you're aware of a deficiency in our holding in this area, now's the time to highlight that.

Let me know if you have any questions, and thank you!

Ben

Send call out for course reserves CALS,"**Subject:** Submit Your Course Reserve Requests for Spring 2024!

Dear CALS Professors,

As your library liaison, I want to ensure your students have access to the materials they need for your courses. The library’s **course reserves** program allows us to set aside physical and digital resources specifically for your class.

If you have textbooks, readings, or other resources you’d like to make available through the reserves system, I’m happy to help ensure they’re ready for the start of the semester.

To make a request, you can:

- Stop by the library and fill out a reserves request form.
- Complete the online request form: [Reserves Request Form](https://uidaho.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d3UL6u0pxEGpZs2 ""‌"").
- Email the reserves team directly at [libreserve@uidaho.edu](mailto:libreserve@uidaho.edu ""‌"").

You can also browse our current [Course Reserves Listings](https://alliance-uidaho.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/leganto/public/01ALLIANCE_UID/searchlists ""‌"").

Feel free to reach out to me if you have questions or need assistance!

All best,
Andrew",2024-11-21T18:50:21.658Z
