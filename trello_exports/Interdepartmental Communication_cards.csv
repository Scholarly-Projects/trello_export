Evan analytics request,"What are the timelines on these?

- couple weeks

DSOS:

- ""Web traffic to newly released publications"" - i.e. new digital collections, scholarship projects, etc hoping to see if our promotion helps
  - On digital_all we have a list of the last time collections have been updated – do we have a similar list for when they were first published?
  - This is [close](https://vandalsuidaho.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Storage-Library/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B08CE4FE4-218B-4F14-AE56-5732A4E0C44E%7D&file=Digital%20Collections%20Tracking.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&wdsle=0 ""‌"")

  - Thinking about an individual project management checklist that is preserved as a record for reference
    - [Pre and Post Launch Process Comparison](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/ebc04265-bb6d-4c8e-8564-dc3f3f04fab1 ""‌"") Report
- ""Web traffic to Pressbooks platform, promotional site, and documentation"" - this is probably low, traffic at uidaho.pressbooks.pub basically
  - We added GA4 to the code of these sites not long ago, correct?
  - General traffic template + referral
    - [Pressbooks Report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/869b7892-df4f-4b4d-abe8-6f47a1877be5 ""‌"")
- ""web traffic to CDIL projects, instructional content, and frameworks (non-CollectionBuilder)"" - this might be partly Matomo, but probably need a better list of what we are supposed to measure for this. we could start with basic traffic to projects on [http://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu](http://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu ""smartCard-inline"")
  - Are the CDIL sites added to the main GA4 stream? Looks like it is but double checking
  - Need to change to full page URL for domain names
    - just make a copy that is only CDIL

DCT:

- ""Web engagement statistics (as determined by team lead after evaluation)"" - still not sure best, you could look at what Olivia was doing in the last years spreadsheets. could create a dashboard of just traffic to /digital/ as a good start probably
  - [This is /digital/  and the CDIL feed](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/a0c98fe6-e9d9-463e-9b5d-961d02feac39 ""‌""). Do you want another that is just /digital/?

- ""Web acquisition statistics, particularly in terms of driving visitors to/from digital to Harvester and other SPEC websites."" - maybe just look at traffic to Harvester, volume, where does it come from, where do they go after (like to they follow links to Spec or finding aids or our digital collections)
  - I’m not getting any data from the Harvester on our [Special Collections report](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/801496d0-6754-41d5-b3e9-5d7b9d9584de ""‌""). Has it been set  up?

- ""Web engagement statistics (as determined by team lead after evaluation)"" - I guess just basic stats compared to previous years, check if anything different stands out.
