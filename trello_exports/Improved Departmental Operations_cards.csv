- Can’t figure out why there are slight variations between the widgets and the copy paste sections – they are set up exactly the same.
- Also running into repeated issue with Number of Unique Viewers Pie Chart. It is breaking while all of the other charts are functioning
  - Walked through all of the troubleshooting possibilities – disconnected / reconnected filter, erased it and built it again. Removed filter (works) and reattached. Tried changing chart types and it still breaks. There is a possibility that there is too much data which is causing the break but shortening the time frame to seven days still results in No Data
  - Fixed by selecting First User source medium instead of User source/medium – which tracks every session rather than just the initial one  (which is the only one we need – where they came from) User source/medium was breaking the chart because of the amount of information it was bringing in.",2024-12-05T19:59:12.733Z
