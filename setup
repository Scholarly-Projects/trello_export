# Setting Up a Virtual Environment for Python Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

## Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

On Mac

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Step 3: Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Step 4: Locating Trello API Key, API Token, and Board ID

To use the script, you will need to locate your Trello **API Key**, **API Token**, and the **Board ID** for the board you wish to export archived cards from.

### 1. Get Your Trello API Key and API Token
   - Visit the [Trello Developer API Key Page](https://trello.com/app-key).
   - Log in with your Trello account credentials.
   - Go to the [Power-Up Admin Portal](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/)
   - Select **New** Power-Up and Integration
   - On the sidebar, select **API Key**
   - Copy your **API Key** from the page save into a safe document
   - To the right of the API field, select [manually generate a token](https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&scope=read,write,account&response_type=token&key=1f28d3b35afb7ee011095b37a887e0f3)
   - Approve the requested permissions and copy your **API Token**

### 2. Find Your Board ID
   - Open the Trello board in your web browser
   - Look at the URL. It should look something like this:
     ```
     https://trello.com/b/abcdef123456/my-board-name
     ```
   - The **Board ID** is the string of characters after `/b/` and before the next `/`. In this example, the Board ID is `abcdef123456`.

### 3. Add API Credentials and Board ID to the Script
   - Open the `script.py` file in a text editor
   - Replace the placeholders for `API_KEY`, `API_TOKEN`, and `BOARD_ID` with your actual values:

     ```python
     API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'
     API_TOKEN = 'your_api_token_here'
     BOARD_ID = 'your_board_id_here'
     ```

## Step 5: Run the Script

Once everything is set up, run the script:

```bash
python script.py
```
